<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Public parks play a vital role in urban life, offering spaces for
recreation, relaxation, and community engagement. However, their value
can be compromised by issues like crime, inadequate cleanliness, and
poor sanitation. Our project, <em>Behind the Green: Data Insights Into
NYC Parks’ Cleanliness and Safety</em>, aims to analyze key factors
affecting park visitors’ experiences, including crime rates, restroom
conditions, cleanliness, and syringe litter. By uncovering insights
through data analysis, we hope to guide improvements and ensure NYC
parks remain safe, clean, and welcoming for all.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>For the crime in NYC parks,</p>
<p>About the sanitation aspect, we firstly analyze the <a
href="cleanliness.html">cleanliness of NYC parks</a>, identifying
specific features contributing to lower cleanliness scores, as well as
examining temporal and spatial variations. This allows us to pinpoint
key factors behind the fluctuations in cleanliness levels and formulate
strategies for improvements. Second, understanding and improving the
condition of restrooms is crucial as clean <a
href="restroom.html">restrooms</a> play a significant role in promoting
public health and comfort, encouraging greater park use. Lastly, the
critical issue of <a href="syringe.html">syringe litter</a>, which poses
serious health and safety concerns, especially in public areas where
children and families gather, demands systematic investigation. Our
study aims to gather insights into the extent of this issue to support
informed, data-driven decision-making and interventions.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p><strong>Data Source</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="crime.html"><strong>Crime</strong></a>:</li>
<li><a href="cleanliness.html"><strong>Cleanliness</strong></a>: The
Cleanliness data comes from the Parks Inspection Program (PIP), which
evaluates New York City parks through regular inspections. PIP assesses
the cleanliness of parks across 17 features, categorized under
cleanliness, structural, and landscape conditions. Each feature is rated
either as “Acceptable” (A) or “Unacceptable” (U), providing insight into
the cleanliness conditions across different locations and features.
Datasets on properties and cleanliness are maintained in this
part.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="restroom.html"><strong>Restroom</strong></a>: Restroom data
is also gathered through PIP and records detailed information about
public restroom inspections in New York City parks. These inspections
rate the restroom facilities for cleanliness and structural quality,
contributing to the overall evaluation of park facilities. This dataset
allows for the analysis of restroom conditions across different parks
and helps to identify potential areas for improvement.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="syringe.html"><strong>Syringe</strong></a>: The Syringe
dataset records syringe collection in NYC Parks, gathered by NYC Parks
staff and various organizations under the Syringe Litter Data Collection
initiative. The data highlights syringe disposal patterns and is
accessible via NYC OpenData. The syringe collection data provides
valuable insights into the safety and public health conditions of NYC
Parks and is compiled monthly after thorough quality checks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Cleaning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="crime.html"><strong>Crime</strong></a>:</li>
<li><a href="cleanliness.html"><strong>Cleanliness</strong></a>:
Initially, multiple datasets were loaded and cleaned to ensure
consistent column names. Relevant cleanliness features, including
Litter, Glass, Graffiti, Weeds, and Ice, were selected for focused
analysis. The datasets were then merged based on <code>prop_id</code>
and <code>inspection_id</code> to create a comprehensive dataset
encompassing park information, feature ratings, and cleanliness
inspection data. Finally, the combined dataset was further cleaned and
standardized by addressing missing values, removing unnecessary columns,
and formatting string values to maintain data consistency.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="restroom.html"><strong>Restroom</strong></a>: The data
cleaning process involved importing three datasets (toilet_inspection,
parks_inspection, and sites_inspection) and standardizing their column
names using <code>janitor::clean_names()</code>. The datasets are then
merged based on common identifiers (<code>inspection_id</code> and
<code>prop_id</code>). New features, such as the year column, are
created, and unnecessary columns were removed. Data is filtered to
include only public restrooms and relevant columns. Missing values in
the <code>pr_litter</code> column are removed, and categorical values in
<code>season</code> and <code>boro</code> are standardized. Finally, the
dataset is filtered to include records from 2015 to 2024, ensuring a
clean and consistent dataset for analysis.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="syringe.html"><strong>Syringe</strong></a>: The dataset on
syringe findings in NYC parks was processed through several key cleaning
steps. First, we standardized the date-time information by converting
the collected_date field to a consistent format and extracting the year
component. We also standardized the month names using the abbreviated
format. Missing values in syringe counts (<code>ground_syringes</code>,
<code>kiosk_syringes</code>, <code>total_syringes</code>) and
kiosk_numbers were replaced with zeros to ensure consistent numerical
analysis. Duplicate entries were removed using distinct(), and records
with invalid location values (where location = “0”) were filtered out.
Especially, we updated <code>kiosk_site</code> to TRUE where
<code>kiosk_syringes</code> &gt; 0, this ensures locations with recorded
kiosk usage are properly flagged.</li>

<h4>2.1 Overall Cleanliness</h4>
<p><strong>The proportions of three rating types for different
features</strong></p>
<p>From the bar chart below, we can observe the proportions of three
rating types — Unacceptable (U), Very Unacceptable (U/S), and their
combined proportion (U + U/S) — for different features (Glass, Graffiti,
Ice, Litter, and Weeds).</p>
<p><img src="images/report/1_prop_for_features.png" class="center"></p>
<ul>
<li>For all features, the proportion of “U/S” is relatively low compared
to the “U” rating, suggesting that while some features may have been
rated very unacceptable, the majority of issues fall into the
unacceptable category without additional safety concerns.<br />
</li>
<li><code>Litter</code>: The feature “Litter” has the highest combined
(U + U/S) and individual “U” proportions compared to all other features.
This indicates that litter is the most problematic feature in terms of
cleanliness, frequently being rated as unacceptable.<br />
</li>
<li><code>Weeds</code>: Weeds have relatively high values for both “U”
and “U + U/S” proportions. This suggests that weeds are also a
significant cleanliness issue.<br />
</li>
<li><code>Graffiti</code>: Graffiti shows a moderate level of
unacceptable ratings (both “U” and “U + U/S”), indicating that it is
frequently, but not as consistently as Litter, rated as
problematic.<br />
</li>
<li><code>Glass</code> and <code>Ice</code>: Both features have
relatively low proportions across all rating types, suggesting that
these features are generally well-maintained and less frequently rated
as unacceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The least error-prone feature in different
boroughs</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/report/least_error.png" class="center" style="width: 50%;"></p>
<p>The table shows the feature in each borough with the highest
proportion of “A” cleanliness ratings, indicating which features are the
least error-prone in terms of cleanliness for each borough. The data
includes results for five boroughs: Brooklyn (B), Manhattan (M), Queens
(Q), Staten Island (R), and Bronx (X).</p>
<p>Ice is the best-maintained feature in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens,
and Bronx, with “A” rating proportions ranging from 97.91% to 98.85%.
This indicates consistent cleanliness management across these boroughs.
In Staten Island, Glass has the highest “A” rating at 98.87%, suggesting
a different focus in cleanliness efforts. Overall, Ice appears to be
easier to maintain across multiple boroughs, while Glass is notably
well-managed in Staten Island.</p>
<p><strong>The cleanliness ratings of NYC and its boroughs during the
decade</strong></p>
<p>We calculated and compared the overall “A” rating proportion of
cleanliness in each borough and the whole New York City each year, and
analyzed the cleanliness trend in different boroughs.</p>
<p><img src="images/report/2_A_ratio_of_boro.png" class="center"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Trend</strong>: The overall Acceptable proportion
for New York City (grey line) shows a steady increase from around 90% in
2015 to 93% by 2018, followed by a significant decline around 2020, with
a slight recovery in 2022.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Inter-Borough</strong>: <code>Staten Island</code> and
<code>Queens</code> show significantly higher cleanliness levels
compared to other boroughs, whereas the <code>Bronx</code> and
<code>Brooklyn</code> display noticeably lower cleanliness in certain
years.<br />
</li>
<li>The <code>Bronx</code> exhibits large fluctuations in cleanliness,
with a sharp decline in 2022 to below 87%, marking it as the borough
with the lowest cleanliness proportion. <code>Manhattan</code> shows a
steady increase from 92% in 2015, peaking in 2018, with slight
fluctuations but maintaining relatively high cleanliness levels.
<code>Brooklyn</code> sees an improvement after 2017, a notable dip
around 2020, and a recovery to above 90% by 2022.<br />
</li>
<li><code>Staten Island</code> consistently maintains an Acceptable
proportion above 96%, making it the most stable and cleanest borough
throughout the period. <code>Queens</code> starts with a high
cleanliness proportion in 2015, rising significantly after 2018 to
nearly 97%, and remains one of the leading boroughs despite a slight
decline.<br />
</li>
<li>The decline around 2020 could be attributed to pandemic-related
resource shortages and increased maintenance challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis of cleanliness and park category</strong><br />
Then, we studied the association between park types and cleanliness and
analyzed which park types were more likely to accumulate litter.</p>
<p><img src="images/report/3_prop_by_category.png" class="center"></p>
<ul>
<li>It can be found that the proportion of “N” ratings is small but
slightly higher in categories like Large Park and Other, suggesting some
missing or incomplete cleanliness data in these types of parks.<br />
</li>
<li>The proportion of “A” ratings is consistently high across all park
categories, almost reaching 100%. This indicates that most parks
received an acceptable cleanliness rating.<br />
</li>
<li>The proportion of “U” ratings is relatively low, with noticeable
increases in the <code>Large Park</code> and <code>Small Park</code>
categories. Specifically, <code>Large Park</code> shows a higher
percentage of “U” ratings.<br />
</li>
<li>Other categories, such as <code>Greenstreet</code>,
<code>Large Center</code>, and <code>Small Center</code>, show almost no
“U” ratings, with proportions close to 0%.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="restroom-sanitation" class="section level4">
<h4>2.2 Restroom Sanitation</h4>
<p><strong>Distribution of Restroom Sanitation Conditions</strong></p>
<p>We analyzed the distribution of restroom sanitation ratings, with
categories “Acceptable (A),” “Unacceptable (U),” “Not Rated (N),” and
“Very Unacceptable (U/S).”</p>
<p><img src="images/report/restroom_report_1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The majority (78.7%) of restrooms are rated as “Acceptable,” while
18.9% remain “Not Rated.” Only small percentages are classified as
“Unacceptable” (1.37%) or “Very Unacceptable” (1.06%).</p>
<p><strong>Restroom Sanitation by Borough and Park Type</strong></p>
<p>Next, we examined how sanitation conditions vary by borough and park
type (category).</p>

<p>By borough, the Bronx has the highest percentage of “Acceptable”
restrooms (84.3%), followed by Queens (80.8%). Other boroughs report
similar low percentages for “Unacceptable” and “Very Unacceptable.” By
park type, Restrooms in both large and small parks are mostly rated as
“Acceptable” (79.1% and 78.5%, respectively). Small parks have slightly
higher “Not Rated” percentages (19.2%) compared to large parks (18%),
but “Unacceptable” and “Very Unacceptable” ratings are consistently low
across both types.</p>
<p><strong>Trends in Restroom Sanitation Ratings by
Season-Year</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/report/restroom_report_4.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Seasonal trends show that restroom sanitation is generally better in
summer and fall, with “Acceptable” ratings reaching 80%-90%. Winter sees
a drop to 75%-80%, possibly due to weather-related maintenance
challenges, while spring ratings improve as weather warms.</p>
<p><strong>Visitor Count and Restroom Sanitation</strong></p>
<p>We examined the relationship between restroom sanitation and visitor
counts.</p>
<p><img src="images/report/restroom_report_5.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Restrooms with higher visitor counts are more likely to have lower
ratings, especially “Very Unacceptable” conditions, emphasizing the need
for focused maintenance in high-traffic areas.</p>

<h4>2.3 Syringe Litter Issue</h4>
<p><strong>Top 10 Locations with the Highest Average Annual Increase in
Syringe Findings</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/report/top_10_locations.png" class="center"></p>
<p>We found that Aqueduct Walk and St. Mary’s Park show significantly
higher rates of increase, with approximately 4,000 and 3,500 additional
syringes per year respectively. These two parks require immediate
attention to address the growing syringe litter issue.</p>
<p><strong>Total Syringe Distribution</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/report/total_syringes_distribution.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The total syringes distribution shows a heavily skewed distribution,
with a significant number of parks having a very low number of syringes,
and a small number of parks having a very high number of syringes.</p>
<p>The data provides important insights into the scale and distribution
of this public health and safety concern, which can help policymakers
and local authorities determine where to focus their efforts and
resources to address the problem of improper syringe disposal in NYC’s
green spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal Trends in Syringe Findings</strong></p>

</div>
<p>The monthly syringe findings from 2017 to 2024 reveal a clear
increasing trend over the years, with 2022 showing the highest peak of
nearly 30,000 syringes in July. The data demonstrates consistent
seasonal patterns, with higher counts typically occurring during summer
months (June-September) and lower counts in winter months. Recent years
(2021-2024) show notably higher syringe counts compared to earlier years
(2017-2019), suggesting an intensifying challenge in urban park
maintenance and public health management.</p>
<p><strong>Syringe Findings by Property Type and Borough</strong></p>

</div>
<p>For the boroughs, the graph shows that the Bronx leads with over 200
unique locations, followed by Manhattan with approximately 160
locations, indicating that this issue is more prevalent in these two
boroughs compared to others like Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten
Island.</p>
<p>For the property types, traditional parks (PARK) dominate with
approximately 400 unique locations, while other property types -
Greenstreets (GREENST), Playgrounds (PLGD), and Zones (ZONE) - each
report far fewer locations, around 40-50 sites each. This pattern
suggests that syringe-related issues are predominantly concentrated in
standard park areas rather than specialized recreational spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Kiosk Utilization over Time</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/report/kiosk_utilization_rate.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The kiosk utilization rate demonstrates a pronounced downward trend
from 2018 to 2024. During the early period (2017-2020), utilization
fluctuated considerably between 40-70%, with peak rates reaching around
70%. A significant decline occurred post-2021, with rates steadily
dropping to approximately 10-15% by 2024. This substantial decrease
suggests a concerning trend in the effectiveness or acceptance of the
kiosk disposal program over time, particularly in recent years.</p>
<p><strong>Ground Findings vs. Kiosk Findings over Time</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/report/ground_vs_kiosk_syringes.png" class="center"></p>
<p>This plot compares ground-found and kiosk-collected syringes from
2017 to 2024, revealing a stark contrast between collection methods.
Ground syringes (shown in blue) demonstrate high variability and an
overall increasing trend, with peaks reaching over 25,000 in 2022. In
contrast, kiosk collections (shown in green) remain consistently lower,
rarely exceeding 5,000 syringes, and show a declining trend toward zero
by 2024. This disparity suggests that despite the implementation of
kiosk disposal programs, ground collection remains the predominant
method of syringe recovery in NYC parks.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The analysis of NYC parks reveals several critical insights.</p>
<p>For <a href="crime.html"><strong>Crime</strong></a> in NYC parks,</p>
<p>Regarding <a
href="cleanliness.html"><strong>Cleanliness</strong></a>, certain
features, seasons, and boroughs were identified as factors that
influence cleanliness levels. Features such as graffiti and litter
consistently showed lower cleanliness scores, with cleanliness ratings
varying seasonally, generally better in winter. Borough-level
differences indicate the need for targeted interventions in areas
lagging behind. These results align with our expectations and emphasize
the importance of feature-specific solutions and seasonal
adjustments.</p>
<p>For <a href="restroom.html"><strong>Restroom</strong></a> conditions,
the findings show a disparity across boroughs, with Brooklyn and
Manhattan often reporting higher rates of unacceptable conditions. The
data also suggest that higher visitor counts, particularly during spring
and summer, lead to a decline in sanitation. Although many restrooms
maintain acceptable conditions, a notable number still fall under
“Unacceptable” or “Very Unacceptable” categories, highlighting areas
that require improvement.</p>
<p>In terms of <a href="syringe.html"><strong>Syringe</strong></a>
litter, the analysis points out that traditional parks are the primary
locations for syringe findings, significantly outnumbering other
property types like Greenstreets and Playgrounds. The Bronx and
Manhattan have the highest number of affected locations, and the peak
findings during summer suggest seasonal trends that need attention.
Regression analysis reveals the need for revising harm reduction
strategies, focusing on more effective interventions in high-risk areas,
particularly given the reduced utilization of kiosks and increasing
ground findings. Addressing these issues requires further research into
environmental factors and targeted policy adjustments.</p>
