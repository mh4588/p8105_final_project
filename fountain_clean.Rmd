For cleaning the fountain dataset before loading onto the shiny app.
```{r loading}
library(tidyverse)
#Load data
fountains <- read.csv("data/fountains.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()#is it read.csv or read_csv just checking
```

```{r}
#Clean data
fountain_location = fountains |>
  select(prop_name, point, fountain_type, feature_status)

#Clean point variable
fount_loc_with_points = fountain_location |>
  mutate(
    coords = str_split_fixed(gsub("POINT \\(|\\)", "", point), " ", 2),
    longitude = as.numeric(coords[,1]),
    latitude = as.numeric(coords[,2])
  ) |>
  select(prop_name, longitude, latitude, fountain_type, feature_status)

```

not sure if you needs the following
```{r export}
write_csv(fount_loc_with_points, "fountain_location.csv")
```
